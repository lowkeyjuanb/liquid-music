# ðŸŽµ ASCII Music Visualizer: Liquid Music

## ðŸ“œ Description
This project is an experimental **ASCII animation engine** built with Python. The main goal is to create smooth, real-time **ASCII animations** directly in the terminal. 

The next milestone is to make the animations **react to music in real time**, generating visual patterns, waves, or other effects based on audio input. The idea is to blend art, audio, and code â€” turning the terminal into a visualizer for sound.

## ðŸ’¡ Goals
- Create smooth ASCII-based animations
- Implement a wave or particle system using ASCII characters
- Integrate **real-time audio input**
- Visualize sound frequencies, amplitudes, or beats with ASCII effects

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- `math` and `numpy` for numerical operations
- `pyaudio` or `sounddevice` for audio input (planned)

## ðŸ”® Future Plans
- Implement FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to analyze real-time audio input
- Map audio frequencies to visual ASCII effects
- Support microphone or audio file as input source
- Experiment with colorized terminal output for enhanced visuals

## ðŸŽ¯ Example Use Cases (Planned)
- Real-time music visualizer reacting to any audio played
- Terminal-based ASCII art animations synced with music beats
- A retro-style audio-reactive "screensaver"
